---AUTHOR'S NOTE---

What I have done to remix what I've written in unit 2 to unit 3 is by putting it into a form that is more digestible for learners; the information from unit two is presented through a lecture in unit three. This lesson will either be recorded on video like a Zoom call or I’ll be able to teach it in front of the class since my class has this activity where I can present whatever I have done in this unit.

Some of the more specific things that I’ve done in this lecture style remix of unit 2 is to try to make the presentation, and by extension, the class more interactive similar to how the professor of this English class teaches. What I have done presentation wise is adding transitions and visuals to try to make the slide pop out more instead of the bland transitions that simply encourage phone use. This class is going to have more of a high school teaching style as well because there is a higher degree of class participation. However, I know that this more informal, less professional style of teaching is more common in underclassman classes and Gen Eds. I also decided to post the sources in my GitHub page (mostly as an excuse to use it more since I have barely touched it since my introductory computer science class). Another major change between unit two and unit three is that the text found in unit three contain more bullet points and summarized texts rather than paragraphs and word walls with complicated in-text citations. 

These changes match the conventions/expectations of the genre of a lecture as well as the content of its audience because everything taught in the lecture will be explained in depth as well as lecture slides that are simple enough to take notes from. Another expectation of the audience in a lecture is participation, especially for underclassman courses. This is because the main purpose of an underclassman course is to transition between high school education and upper level education. Although I will maintain a degree of professionalism while lecturing, I also want to encourage a chill environment that isn’t as hostile as upperclassman courses. 

The process of making lecture slides as a way to remix what I’ve written in unit two was pretty fast and straightforward. This is because I used to make presentations as a group project back in high school and I enjoyed the process from making to sharing. I think the most tedious part of making a presentation with the purpose of presenting it as a lecture so that the audience can learn and take notes from it are transitions and appropriate visuals. Transitions are tedious because most of them are done manually, especially animations done within a slide. Meanwhile, visuals need to be appropriate for the given slide that I am presenting. 

Overall, this remixing was fun and I enjoyed presenting it to class, but there’s another reason as to why I chose to remix unit two do something lecture based; I plan to be a professor with my major after getting a masters/PhD degree with my major. Not only that, but I also want to do research in the field of knowledge time majoring in as of now generally, I am glad about taking this class because I know that I have the potential to write something very scientific with a lot of research and technical jargon.
